# Power BI Dashboard of World Trade of Commodities

## Dashboards Of My Medical Research Paper :microscope: And World Trade :earth_asia: Of Commodities 

In this project, I have aggregated Data of World Trade of Commodities from United Nations. Then i have performed data preprocessing on it to combine similar excel files 
like silk, wool and cotton into clothing. In the same way I have combined commodities of similar niche into one segment. Then i have imported the data in Power BI and 
made the following report:





## Setup

So we talked about what telephone based social engineering attacks are, and what they can do for you (among other things). <br/>
Let's get this thing running! Follow the next steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/abideenml/ResearchProjects`
2. Navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo` and then move to  `Detecting-Telephone-based-Social-Engineering-Attacks` folder.
3. Create a new venv environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `DocToVec_KMeans_+_EM_CLustering_Classifications_+_DBSCAN.ipynb` and `Universal_Vector_Encoding_KMeans_+_EM_+_DBSCAN_Clustering_Classifications.ipynb` file.

That's it! It should work out-of-the-box executing requirements.txt file which deals with dependencies. <br/>





## Todos:

Finally there are a couple more todos which I'll hopefully add really soon:
* Explore how open source LLMs can be used to detect these scams.
* Make a data pipeline with Kedro and MLflow.
* Deploy the models and learn the effect of drift on their performance.
