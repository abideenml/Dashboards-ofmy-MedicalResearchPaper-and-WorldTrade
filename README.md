# Dashboards Of My Medical Research Paper :microscope: And World Trade :earth_asia: Of Commodities 

In this project, I have aggregated Data of World Trade of Commodities from United Nations. Then i have performed data preprocessing on it to combine similar excel files like silk, wool and cotton into clothing. In the same way I have combined commodities of similar niche into one segment. Then i have imported the data in Power BI and 
made the following report:

This repo contains the Dashboards of my Medical Research Paper (:link: [Fauzia et al.](https://pjmhsonline.com/index.php/pjmhs/article/view/4054/4006)) and World trade of Commodities. <br/>

## Setup


Let's get this thing running! Follow the next steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/abideenml/Dashboards-ofmy-MedicalResearchPaper-and-WorldTrade`
2. Navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Open the PowerBI dashboards file: `Powerbi Report of Commodities data.pbix`, `Influence of Medical  Education on Personality.pbix` and `Student Response Dashboard.pbix`.

That's it! <br/>





## Todos:

Finally there are a couple more todos which I'll hopefully add really soon:
* Automate the entire process of Data preprocessing and scraping from International Monetary Fund website.
* Perform Data collection from different Pakistani Medical Colleges.
