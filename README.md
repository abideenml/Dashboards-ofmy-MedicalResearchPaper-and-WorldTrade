# Power BI Dashboard of World Trade of Commodities

## Dashboards Of My Medical Research Paper :microscope: And World Trade :earth_asia: Of Commodities 

In this project, I have aggregated Data of World Trade of Commodities from United Nations. Then i have performed data preprocessing on it to combine similar excel files 
like silk, wool and cotton into clothing. In the same way I have combined commodities of similar niche into one segment. Then i have imported the data in Power BI and 
made the following report:

## Setup


Let's get this thing running! Follow the next steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/abideenml/Dashboards-ofmy-MedicalResearchPaper-and-WorldTrade`
2. Navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Open the PowerBI dashboards file: `Powerbi Report of Commodities data.pbix`, `Influence of Medical  Education on Personality.pbix` and `Student Response Dashboard.pbix`.

That's it! <br/>





## Todos:

Finally there are a couple more todos which I'll hopefully add really soon:
* Automate the entire process of Data preprocessing and scraping from International Monetary Fund website.
* Perform Data collection from different Pakistani Medical Colleges.
