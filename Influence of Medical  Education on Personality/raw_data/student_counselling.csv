11/19/2022 16:35:21,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,My presence in a medical college is a clear evidence of guidance of my teachers. And in medical college teachers support only few students this is main problem. Guidelines should be for all not for few students. ,"Definitely if someone counsel is supportive. Every student needs , especially for those students whose parents are from different field and no one is here to guide them . It is really painful when a student with parents from a totally different field fails and see those students who are successful just because they have counselor. And this is main reason students move to seniors which shows them experience of just one year instead of going to teacher with a lot of experience."
