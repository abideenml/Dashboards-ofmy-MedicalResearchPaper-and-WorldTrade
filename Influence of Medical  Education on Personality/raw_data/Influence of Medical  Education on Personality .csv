Being able to help the needy and provide services to mankind and being respected anywhere I go. While cons include that there is a lot of pressure of studies all the time. Not being able to attend many things due to exams or classes. Not having enough free time for myself to engage in other outdoor activities often.

It was the hostel life and real life experiences in regards to everyday life that taught me more. How people's behavior can effect a person , what response to have in situations was something that i learned after mbbs and it was mostly due to the communication gap i had before due to living with my family and being dependent on them.
